Do you like our owl?

Deckard:
It's artificial?

Rachael:
Of course it is.

Deckard:
Must be expensive.

Rachael:
Very.

Rachael:
I'm Rachael.

Deckard:
Deckard.

Rachael:
It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.

Deckard:
Replicants are like any other machine - they're either a benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem
