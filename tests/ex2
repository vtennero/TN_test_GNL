Albert Einstein said, "Technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal."  Took me awhile, but I finally see his point.  How often have we chased the dream of progress, only to see that dream perverted?  More often than not, haven't the machines we built to improve life shattered the lives of millions?  And now we want to turn that dream on ourselves, to fundamentally improve who we are.  Experience has shown me how dangerous that can be.  How many times in the call of duty, did I almost fall into the trap of taking shortcuts, abusing my abilities or the resources at hand?  I resisted -- barely at times - because I valued human lives and considerations.

Can I truly despise others who fall?  Technology offers us strength strength, strength enables dominance, and dominance paves the way for abuse.  Darrow understood this. He know that using technology to become something more than we risks losing are ability to love, aspire, or make moral choices - the very things that make us human.  It also risks giving some men the power to make others what they choose - regardless of the cost to human dignity.  The suffering Darrow inflicted is not the end of the world. It is merely the seed for change. And change never comes without pain.
