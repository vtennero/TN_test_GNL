Sarif was right about one thing it's in our nature to want to rise above our limits  Think about it. we were cold so we harnessed fire we were weak so we invented tools  Every time we met an obstacle we used creativity and ingenuity to overcome it. The cycle is inevitable... but will the outcome always be good?   I guess that will depend on how we approach it.  these past few months I was challenged many times, but more often than not didn't I try to keep morality in mind, knowing that my actions didn't have to harm others.  Time and time again, didn't I resist the urge to abuse power and resources simply to achieve my goals more swiftly?  In the past we've had to compensate for weaknesses, finding quick solutions that only benefit a few.  But what if we never need to feel weak or morally conflicted again?  What if the path Sarif wants us to take enables us to hold on to higher values with more stability?  One thing is obvious for the first time in history we have a chance to steal fire from the gods.  To turn away from it now - to stop pursing a future in which technology in which technology and biology combine leading to the promise of a singularity - would mean to deny the very essence of who we are.  No doubt the road to get there will be bumpy, hurting some people along the way.   But won't achieving the dream be worth it?  We can become the gods we've always been striving to be.  We might as well get good at it.
